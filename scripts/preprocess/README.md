TODO: 
- explain the following:
    - these scripts work on the raw data, which is not available anymore
    - describe the raw data directory structure; files in each workbook (ex: queries.sql)
    - scripts that do not expect dataset-dir as parameter usually assume that the current directory is the dataset root directory
    - most scripts expect the files to be already decompressed (.csv not csv.bz2)
    - numbered scripts are meant to be executed in order
